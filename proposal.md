### Notes/concerns/risks

This is a very interesting project which also happens to be graduate research field. My only concern is, this is a rather big project that builds on top of other big open-source project such as `Docker` & `Kafka` etc. Which results in a very lower chance of any feature enhancement contribution (given the time limitation). However, this seems a fast moving project with very responsive community which will definitely give me more exposure as a professional.
